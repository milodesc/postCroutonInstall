A bash script to run after installing crouton (xubuntu 12.04) on an Acer C710 chromebook. The script mainly downloads and installs some popular web development tools:

- LAMP server
- git
- sass/compass
- guake
- a script to easily create a new local dev site
- sublime text 2

It also installs some other useful programs:
- libreoffice
- gimp

Usage
=====
After installing crouton on your Acer 710 chromebook, simply download and run:
    postCroutonInstall.sh

Then sit back and relax as the script downloads and installs all the programs.
